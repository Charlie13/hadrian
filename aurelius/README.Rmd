# aurelius

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ReportMort/hadrian/hadrian.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ReportMort/hadrian) [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/ReportMort/hadrian/master.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/ReportMort/hadrian?branch=master)

**aurelius** is a toolkit for generating PFA in the R programming language. It 
focuses on porting models to PFA from their R equivalents.

Supported Models:

  - glm
  - glmnet
  - randomForest
  - gbm
  
### Install and Load aurelius Library

```{r eval = FALSE}

devtools::install_github('opendatagroup/hadrian', subdir='aurelius')
library("aurelius")

```

### Build a Model and Save as PFA

The main purpose of the package is to create PFA documents based on logic created 
in R. This example shows how to build a simple linear regression model and save 
as PFA. PFA is a plain-text JSON format.

```{r eval = FALSE}

  # build a model
  lm_model <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)
  
  # convert the lm object to a list of lists PFA representation
  lm_model_as_pfa <- pfa(lm_model)
```

The model can be saved as PFA JSON and used in other systems.

```{r write-model, eval=FALSE}
  # save as plain-text JSON
  write_pfa(lm_model_as_pfa, file = "my-model.pfa")
```

Just as models can be written as a PFA file, they can be read.

```{r read-model, eval=FALSE}
  my_model <- read_pfa("my-model.pfa")
```
